- 👋 Howdy, I’m @AxelFrostCodes !
- 👀 I’m interested in Tech, science, video games, AI, robotics, global change, IT, and music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS basics (Feb 2 2022) , followed by Javascript (???)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can hone my skills
- 📫 You can reach me through email at Gyenessed@gmail.com  

Any assistance along my learning journey would be greatly appreciated. I plan to start with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and later - possibly - incorporate some PHP
for full-stack development of web pages. If you would like to reach out via Email, please include some form of GITHUB in your email title, so it is not caught by an aggressive filter!
